			<B>3. BITKIT SERVICES</B>
		</P>
		<P>
			<BI>This section contains the terms of use for the self-custodial Bitkit Wallet through which the user may access the Lightning Connection Services and other Bitkit Services.</BI>
		</P>
		<P>3.1 Subject to these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Bitkit Wallet and other Bitkit Services for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the respective terms and features of the individual Bitkit Services. Synonym reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Bitkit Services and the Synonym Content (as defined below). Synonym may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</P>
		<P>3.2 You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Synonym shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</P>
		<P>3.3 We may, without prior notice, change the Bitkit Services (including the Bitkit Wallet); stop providing any of the Bitkit Services or features of the Bitkit Services, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Bitkit Services. Some Bitkit Services may not be available to you. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Bitkit Services without notice and liability for any reason, including: (i) your violation of these Terms; (ii) if Synonym determines or suspects that you have ceased to be an Eligible User or any Recipient is a Prohibited Person; (iii) scheduled or unscheduled maintenance; (iv) addressing any emergency security concerns or other force majeure event or (v) for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.</P>
		<P>3.4 You may use the Bitkit Services solely in accordance with these Terms. You shall not take any steps to circumvent, avoid, bypass or obviate, directly or indirectly, the intent of these Terms.</P>

		<P>
			<B>4. BITKIT WALLET</B>
		</P>
		<P>
			<BI>This section sets out the services Synonym provides and who is eligible to use those services.</BI>
		</P>
		<P>4.1 <U>Bitkit Wallet.</U></P>
		<P>4.1.1 Your use of the Bitkit Wallet allows you to (i) store and access Supported Assets; (ii) broadcast transactions in Supported Assets; (iii) engage in peer-to-peer communication of selected information and (iv) access Third-Party Services. Additional functionality may be added from time to time.</P>
		<P>4.1.2 Your Bitkit Wallet is intended solely for proper use of Supported Assets. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Bitkit Wallet to store, send, request, or receive any assets other than Supported Assets. Synonym assumes no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use your Bitkit Wallet with Digital Assets that it does not support. You acknowledge and agree that Synonym is not liable for any unsupported Digital Asset that is sent to a wallet address associated with your Bitkit Wallet. Synonym may in its sole discretion terminate support for any particular Digital Asset. Services and Supported Assets may vary by jurisdiction and may change without notice to you.</P>
		<P><B>4.1.3 You own and control the Supported Assets held in your Bitkit Wallet. As the owner of Supported Assets in your Bitkit Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. Bitkit shall have no liability for Digital Asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of a Bitkit Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Supported Assets by sending it to a different blockchain address</B></P>
		<P>4.2 <U>Digital Asset Transfers.</U></P>
		<P>4.2.1 Your Bitkit Wallet enables you to send Supported Assets to, and request, receive, and store Supported Assets from, third parties, through a Supported Asset Network. Your transfer of Supported Assets between your other Digital Asset wallets and to and from third parties through a Supported Asset Network is a “Wallet Asset Transfer”. We recommend Users send a small amount of Supported Assets as a test before sending a significant amount of Supported Assets.</P>
		<P>4.2.2 Once a Wallet Asset Transfer is submitted to a Supported Asset Network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to allow confirmation of the transaction by the Supported Asset Network. A Wallet Asset Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Wallet Asset Transfers that are initiated from a Bitkit Wallet will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use in the Bitkit Wallet or otherwise while the transaction is pending. Features of the Bitkit Wallet which estimate the time during which a transaction will be confirmed, or indicate that a transaction will occur more quickly in the event that additional fees are paid, may prove to be incorrect or incomplete.</P>
		<P>4.2.3 You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to pay network or miner’s fees for a Wallet Asset Transfer to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause a Wallet Asset Transfer to remain in a pending state. Synonym has no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.</P>
		<P>4.2.4 When you or a third party sends Digital Assets to a Bitkit Wallet from an external wallet (<B>“Wallet Inbound Transfers”</B>), the Person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which includes ensuring that the Digital Asset being sent is a Supported Asset that conforms to the particular wallet address to which Supported Assets are directed, including any required destination tag/memo. By initiating a Wallet Inbound Transfer, you attest that you are transacting in a Supported Asset that conforms to the particular wallet address to which Supported Assets are directed. <B>Synonym incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported Digital Assets sent to a Bitkit Wallet or with regard to Supported Assets sent to an incompatible Digital Asset wallet address and/or unsupported network or blockchain. All such erroneously transmitted Digital Assets will be lost.</B> Synonym may from time to time determine types of Digital Assets that will be supported or cease to be supported by the Bitkit Wallet.</P>
		<P>4.2.5 When you send Supported Assets from your Bitkit Wallet to an external wallet (<B>“Wallet Inbound Transfers”</B>), such transfers are executed by you on your instruction. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions. Synonym shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address, incorrect destination tag/memo, or if you send your Digital Assets to an incompatible wallet. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of a Wallet Outbound Transfer. Wallet Asset Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Supported Asset Network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Synonym does not control any Digital Asset network and makes no guarantees that a Wallet Asset Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may cancel or refuse to process any pending Wallet Outbound Transfers as required by Law or any court or other authority to which Synonym is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Bitkit Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</P>

		<P>
			<B>5. LIGHTNING CONNECTION SERVICES</B>
		</P>
		<P>
			<BI>This section contains the terms of use for the Lightning Connection Services. Please note that the Lightning Connection Services may not be available for all Users.</BI>
		</P>
		<P>5.1 The Bitkit Wallet enables certain Eligible Users to purchase Blocktank Connections of a chosen Connection Capacity for a Connection Duration, which may be identified in the Bitkit Wallet as “instant” or “instant payments”.</P>
		<P>5.2 Subject to these Terms (including you satisfying your obligations to make the Connection Payment), a Blocktank Connection shall be established between the User Node (being your Bitkit Wallet) and the Blocktank Node. Any Blocktank Connection shall be funded by Synonym or its Associates up to the Connection Capacity in accordance with Section 5.5 (Fees and Funding) of these Terms. The Blocktank Connection shall be a multi-signature arrangement controlled by you but subject to cancellation by Synonym.</P>
		<P>5.3 <U>Transactional Limits.</U></P>
		<P>5.3.1 Subject to any further written agreement between you and Synonym, the maximum Connection Capacity, when taken in aggregate with all Blocktank Connections or other Lightning Network channels with the Blocktank Node, is the equivalent in BTC of US$999, at the bid price for BTC in U.S. dollars on Bitfinex.com at the time the Blocktank Connection is established.</P>
		<P>5.3.2 Synonym reserves the right to impose additional transaction limits on any particular User or group of Users and to suspend or terminate a User’s use of the Bitkit Wallet or any Connection (including if Synonym believes that such transaction may violate these Terms, applicable Law or otherwise).</P>
		<P>5.3.3 Synonym may implement protective measures to ensure that any User does not breach any transactional limitations imposed thereon. The absence or ineffectiveness of any protective measures shall have no effect on the restrictions of any User pursuant to these Terms.</P>
		<P>5.4 <U>Closure of Blocktank Connections:</U></P>
		<P><I>In this section, we discuss how and when we may close Blocktank Connections. It is important to note that, whilst you may choose a minimum duration for your Blocktank Connection, we may keep Blocktank Connections open for longer than the minimum duration, at our discretion. You may request to close a Blocktank Connection as further described in this section. In certain circumstances, we may elect to close a Blocktank Connection, through cooperative or force close, before the Connection Duration expires. This section also sets out your and our rights and obligations, after a Blocktank Connection is closed.</I></P>
		<P>5.4.1 Upon purchasing a Blocktank Connection, you shall be required to confirm how long you wish the Blocktank Connection to be open (the Connection Duration). The configurable Connection Duration shall be 6 weeks, subject to the rights of Synonym to extend or reduce such maximum or minimum Connection Duration at any time, without notice to you and to otherwise close a Blocktank Connection pursuant to these Terms. Irrespective of any Connection Duration, Synonym may opt, in its sole discretion, to extend or reduce the duration of any Blocktank Connection in accordance with these Terms.</P>
		<P>5.4.2 Notwithstanding the Connection Duration, you may request to close your Blocktank Connection at any time by utilising your preferred software to request a cooperative closure (a <B>“Closure Request”</B>). Synonym has no obligation to respond to, or cooperate with, any Closure Request. In the event that Synonym does not cooperate with any Closure Request, you may initiate a forced closure of a Blocktank Connection by submitting the latest state onto the Bitcoin on-chain network (a <B>“Force Close”</B>). Upon any request for a Force Close, you may be required to wait for a period of time (being not less than two weeks) before receiving any BTC standing to your credit in the Blocktank Connection. Synonym and its Associates shall have no liability or responsibility for any Losses directly or indirectly arising out of or related to a Force Close and any delays experienced by a User in receiving BTC as a result of any Force Close (including any fluctuations in the price of BTC during such time).</P>
		<P>5.4.3 Notwithstanding the Connection Duration, Synonym retains the right to close a Blocktank Connection prior to the Connection Duration, through cooperative or Force Close, at its discretion. Synonym may utilise this right: (i) with your written consent (which may take the form of you providing a digital signature to authorise a cooperative settlement transaction); (ii) if Synonym determines or suspects that you have violated, breached, or acted inconsistent with any of these Terms or exposed Synonym or its Associates to civil, criminal, or administrative penalties or to Economic Sanctions or other restrictive trade measures or Losses pursuant to applicable Laws, or in connection with an investigation regarding any of the foregoing; (iii) if Synonym determines or suspects that any representations or warranties provided by you pursuant to these Terms are incorrect or later cease to be correct; (iv) as required under applicable Laws or pursuant to a request or demand by any Government; (v) if your Blocktank Connection has been inactive for fourteen or more days; (vi) to perform software upgrades that are incompatible with your Blocktank Connection as a result of any failure, malfunction, error, data loss or technical issue encountered by your Blocktank Connection, the Bitkit Wallet, or the Lightning Network or otherwise, or (vii) if otherwise permitted pursuant to these Terms.</P>
		<P>5.4.4 Following expiry of the Connection Duration, Synonym has the right, but not the obligation, to close a Blocktank Connection, through cooperative or Force Close, at its discretion. Synonym retains the right to keep a Blocktank Connection open for an indefinite period, at its sole discretion. In order to request closure of a Blocktank Connection, you may follow the procedure set out in Section 5.4.2.</P>
		<P>5.5 <U>Fees and Funding</U></P>
		<P><I>The fees and other amounts you will need to pay to Synonym upon opening, or topping up, a Blocktank Connection, and for Routed Payments are made available in the Fee Schedule on the Synonym website at https://bitkit.to/fees. Synonym reserves the right to update the Fee Schedule from time-to-time. It is your responsibility to ensure all fees are agreed and understood prior to use of the Bitkit Services. Note that the BTC you send to us to fund any Spending Balance will generally not be the same token or portion thereof that funds your Blocktank Connection.</I></P>
		<P>5.5.1 Upon acquiring, or requesting an increased capacity of, a Blocktank Connection, you will be required to pay to Synonym:</P>
		<P>a. an amount equal to the desired Spending Balance, if any (the <B>“Funding Amount”</B>); and</P>
		<P>b. an amount equal to the fees calculated by the Bitkit Wallet (the <B>“Set-Up Fees”</B> and together, the <B>“Connection Payment”</B>).</P>
		<P>5.5.2 The Connection Payment must be provided to Synonym in BTC from a wallet owned by you. Synonym has no obligation to open any Blocktank Connection unless and until, and subject at all times to these Terms, it has received the Blocktank Connection Payment in full and confirmed (to the satisfaction of Synonym) BTC.</P>
		<P>5.5.3 Synonym is under no obligation to open, or increase the capacity of, the Blocktank Connection using the Funding Amount received. Instead, Synonym may open or increase the capacity of a Blocktank Connection with a corresponding amount of BTC or LN-BTC held by it or its Associates.</P>
		<P>5.5.4 You, and not Synonym, shall be responsible for any transaction, miner or other fees incurred on the Supported Asset Network for the transmission of the Connection Payment to Synonym and for the closure or opening, or any increase in capacity, of any Blocktank Connection and the related recordation by the Bitcoin blockchain.</P>
		<P>5.5.5 Any Routed Payment shall incur fees, payable to Synonym, as set out in the Fee Schedule.</P>
		<P>5.5.6 The Routing Fees shall be payable in BTC and are additional to the LN-BTC routed pursuant to a Routed Payment. Please note that other nodes used to route any Routed Payment to its Recipient may charge additional routing fees. Such additional routing fees shall be in addition to the Routing Fees.</P>
		<P>5.5.7 Synonym reserves the right to amend the Fees payable for the Lightning Connection Services at any time. Any such amendments will be published in the Fee Schedule.</P>
		<P>5.5.8 You agree that any Fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your Blocktank Connection is closed prior to Connection Duration.</P>

		<P>7.3 <U>Fiat Expressions</U>. The Bitkit Wallet enables Users to see values for Supported Assets expressed in certain fiat currencies (<B>“Fiat Expressions”</B>). Fiat Expressions are provided solely as a convenience to the User, and you should not rely upon them as an accurate reflection of the value of your Supported Assets. Fiat Expressions are hypothetical only and may differ materially from the amount of fiat currency that a User could obtain upon exchange at the time that the Fiat Expression is displayed. Factors that may cause these differences include but are not limited to: delays in the transmission of information (i.e. prices are not real-time), unreliable data, calculation errors, taxes, transaction fees, and currency restrictions. Further, the value of Supported Assets can be volatile and unpredictable, and the prices of Digital Assets have been subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be subject to large fluctuations in the future. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</P>
		<P>7.3.1 Fiat Expressions are provided "as is" and "as available", and you hereby disclaim all warranties, express, statutory, or implied (including implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and all warranties arising from course of dealing, usage or trade practice);</P>
		<P>7.3.2 For clarity and without limiting the foregoing, Synonym makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, security, availability, or integrity of the Fiat Expressions or that the Fiat Expressions will be uninterrupted or operate in combination with any software, service, system, or other data; and</P>
		<P>7.3.3 You access and use the Fiat Expressions entirely at your sole risk, and Synonym will not be responsible for any actions you take based on the Fiat Expressions.</P>

			<B>20. MANDATORY RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION</B>
		</P>
		<P>
			<BI>This Section requires that most disputes relating to the Bitkit Services be resolved through individual arbitration.</BI>
		</P>
		<P>20.1 <U>Covered Claims</U>. Except for excluded claims described below in Section 20.2, Synonym and you each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof; (ii) the Bitkit Wallet or other Bitkit Services; or (iii) your use of any Bitkit Services at any time (each, a “Claim”), will be subject to and finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. If you are a Person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America, the interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. Arbitration will be conducted through the use of videoconferencing technology (unless both arbitration parties agree that an in-person hearing is appropriate given the nature of the dispute) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, as amended from time to time (the “ICC Rules”). Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. If the arbitral parties do not promptly agree on to seat of arbitration if an in-person hearing is selected, the seat will be the British Virgin Islands. The language of the arbitral proceedings will be English. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by Law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in court.</P>
		<P>20.2 <U>Excluded Claims</U>. The following claims and causes of action will be excluded from arbitration as described in Section 20.1 causes of action or claims in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of its intellectual property or its confidential information or private data. The Parties shall be at liberty to pursue claims or causes of actions excluded from arbitration through any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
		<P>20.3 <U>Delegation</U>. The arbitrator will have the power to hear and determine challenges to their jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement. This authority extends to jurisdictional challenges with respect to both the subject matter of the dispute and the parties to the arbitration. Further, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the existence, validity, or scope of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, each clause within this Section 20 will be considered as separable from any contract of which it forms a part. Any challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, except challenges based on the award itself, will be made not later than the notice of defense or, with respect to a counterclaim, the reply to the counterclaim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if a claim or counterclaim is later added or amended such a challenge may be made not later than the response to such claim or counterclaim as provided under ICC Rules.</P>
		<P>20.4 <U>Class Action Waiver</U>. You and Synonym expressly intend and agree that: (i) class action and representative action procedures are hereby waived and will not be asserted, nor will they apply, in any arbitration pursuant to these Terms; (ii) neither you nor Synonym will assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; (iii) each of you and Synonym will only submit their own, individual claims in arbitration and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person, or consolidate claims with any other person; (iv) nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as your or Synonym’ intent to arbitrate Claims on a class or representative basis; and (v) any relief awarded to any one User cannot and may not affect any other User. No adjudicator may consolidate or join more than one Person’s or Party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.</P>
		<P>20.5 <U>Confidentiality</U>. You and Synonym and any other arbitration parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by Law or judicial decision.</P>
		<P><B>20.6 <BU>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</BU>. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR ANY BREACH THEREOF, ANY USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE BITKIT SERVICES BY YOU, AND/OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE USER AND SYNONYM.</B></P>

Any failure by Synonym to exercise any of its rights, powers, or remedies under these Terms, or any delay by Synonym in doing so, does not constitute a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. The single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy by Synonym does not prevent either from exercising any other rights, powers, or remedies. The remedies of Synonym are cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by the provisions of these Terms, or by law or equity. You agree that the remedies to which Synonym is entitled include (i) injunctions to prevent breaches of these Terms and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and you waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such remedies, (ii) the right to recover the amount of any Losses by set off against any amounts that Synonym would otherwise be obligated to pay to you, and (iii) the right to seize and recover against any of your assets, or your interests therein, that are held by Synonym or any of its Associates.</P>

None of the provisions of these Terms, or any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of you or Synonym or any other persons, except (i) such as inure to a successor or assign in accordance herewith and (ii) that the Associates of Synonym are intended third party beneficiaries of the rights and privileges expressly stated to apply to the Associates hereunder and shall be entitled to enforce such rights and privileges (including those rights and privileges set out in Sections 10 (<I>Prohibited Uses</I>) and 18 (<I>Responsibilities, Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</I>)) as if a direct party to these Terms. No consent of any Person is required for any modification or amendment to these Terms.</P>
		<P>21.5 <U>No Liability for Termination</U>. Synonym shall not be liable to you or any other Person for termination of your access to the Bitkit Services.</P>
		<P>21.6 <U>Severability</U>. If any provision of these Terms or part thereof, as amended from time to time, is determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability attaches only to such provision to the extent of its illegality, unenforceability, invalidity, or voidness, as may be, and everything else in these Terms continues in full force and effect.</P>
		<P>21.7 <U>Electronic Communications and Acceptance</U>. You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices and disclosures that Synonym may provide in connection with these Terms through publication on any part of the Bitkit Wallet or to your authorized e-mail address on file with Synonym.
