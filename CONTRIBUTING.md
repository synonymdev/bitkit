# Welcome to BitKit docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some general resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/synonymdev/bitkit/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/synonymdev/bitkit/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Windows

Bitkit can be developed on Windows for Android only, to get up and running follow these steps:

1. Install nodejs, the latest security release is [Node v16.18.1 (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.18.1/).
2. Install the java development kit, the simplest way is to download the [OpenJDK11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download) MSI installer that creates the required environment variables. A reset of your machine may be required after.
3. Follow the React Native CLI Quickstart [guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install Android studio, you may ignore the step to install openjdk11 via choco.
